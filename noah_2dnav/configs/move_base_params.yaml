# The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity
# commands to the base.
controller_frequency: 5.0
# How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a
# valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.
controller_patience: 3.0

# The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the
# frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new
# goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is
# blocked.
planner_frequency: 0.5
# How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a
# valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.
planner_patience: 5.0

# How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing
# recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite
# timeout.
oscillation_timeout: 10.0
# How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be
# oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the
# ~oscillation_timeout
